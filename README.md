# Toxic Sky & Plastic Seas

Toxic Sky & Plastic Seas is a Minecraft mod made for [Modfest 1.20 "Sky and Sea"](https://modfest.net/1.20).

It was planned to add toxic/acid rains that damage entities and their equipment, and plastic pollution in the oceans,
that players can collect and recycle to make equipment that is immune to the rains.

Only the ocean garbage islands and simple armor set were implemented so far.

Garbage islands are generated in the deep ocean and can be mined for Plastic Garbage. 
Plastic Garbage can be crafted into Recycled Plastic, which can be used to craft Recycled Plastic Armor.

This armor has chainmail level of protection, but diamond-like durability.
